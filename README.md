To Do-List App

This is a basic To-Do List web application built using HTML, CSS, and Javascript. It allows users to create, view, and delete tasks. I built this as part of my the assessment to create a CRUD module.

Features
‚¶Å	Add new tasks
‚¶Å	View list of tasks
‚¶Å	Delete tasks
‚¶Å	Basic form validation
‚¶Å	Clean and modern UI (HTML/CSS/JS separated)
‚¶Å	Export function to Excel file

üöÄ How to Run the Project
Option 1: Live Demo
You can view the app directly via GitHub Pages:
