   Here's the list of features of what i added:

   <br>‚¶Å Saves tasks to localStorage so changes are remembered.
   <br>‚¶Å Filters tasks (all or completed only).
   <br>‚¶Å Shows task counts (how many are done or not done).

   <br>‚¶Å Exports tasks to Excel using a library (XLSX) instead of JSON files.
