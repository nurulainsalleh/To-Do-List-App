To Do-List App

This is a basic To-Do List web application built using HTML, CSS, and Javascript. It allows users to create, view, and delete tasks. I built this as part of my the assessment to create a CRUD module.

Features
<br> ‚¶Å	Add new tasks
<br>  ‚¶Å	View list of tasks
<br> ‚¶Å	Delete tasks
<br> ‚¶Å	Basic form validation
<br> ‚¶Å	Clean and modern UI (HTML/CSS/JS separated)
<br> ‚¶Å	Export function to Excel file

How to Run the Project
<br> Option 1: Live Demo
<br> View the app directly via GitHub Pages:
